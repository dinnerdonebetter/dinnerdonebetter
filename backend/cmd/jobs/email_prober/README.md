# Email prober

This job basically emails myself at a regular interval. Initially I built it because I use the service so infrequently that SendGrid would restrict my ability to send email until I logged into their dashboard again. 

After running this for a few weeks the problem persisted, so I haven't solved it BUT I do think this would potentially be useful in a world where I was regularly sending email, to ensure email delivery works. 

There are probably other, better ideas for how to test stuff like that.
