# Dinner Done Better

Monorepo for a meal planning application built as a reusable service template.

## Repository Structure

- `backend/` — Go backend (API server, workers, admin app, MCP server)
- `frontend/` — Web frontend
- `ios/` — iOS mobile app
- `proto/` — Protocol Buffer definitions for gRPC services
- `infra/` — Infrastructure Terraform (GKE, networking, DNS, Caddy)
- `docs/` — Cross-cutting documentation (identity, auth, meals, recipes, deployment)

## Template Philosophy

This repo serves dual purposes: a working meal planning app and a reusable service template. The platform framework (database, cache, observability, messaging, etc.) lives in a separate repo at `github.com/primandproper/platform` and is imported as a dependency. `internal/domain/mealplanning` is the example domain built on top. Someone should be able to fork this and swap the meal planning domain for their own without modifying core infrastructure.

## Cross-Cutting Commands

```bash
make proto    # Format + generate proto (Go + Swift + Typescript) from repo root
make build    # builds the backend frontend and iOS folders
make format   # formats the backend frontend and iOS folders
make lint     # lints the backend frontend and iOS folders
make test     # tests the backend frontend and iOS folders
```
