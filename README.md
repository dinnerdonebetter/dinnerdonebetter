## dev dependencies

The following tools are prerequisites for development work:

- [mage](https://www.magefile.org)
    - If you don't have `mage` installed, and you do have `go` installed, you can run `go run mage.go ensureMage` to install it.
    - If you don't have `go` installed, I can't help you.
- [go](https://golang.org/) 1.16+
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [wire](https://github.com/google/wire) for dependency management

You can run `mage -l` to see a list of available targets and their descriptions.

## dev setup

It's a good idea to run `mage quicktest lintegrationTests` before commits. You won't catch every error, but you'll catch the simplest ones that waste CI (and consequently your) time.

## running the server

1. clone this repository
2. run `mage run`
3. [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/)

## working on the frontend

1. In two different shells:
   1. run `mage run`
   2. `cd` into `frontend` and run `pnpm run watch`
2. edit and have fun
