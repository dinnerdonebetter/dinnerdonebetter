---

## 3. Xcode Project Configuration

### Project Settings

- [ ] Set correct Bundle Identifier: `com.dinnerdonebetter.ios`
- [ ] Set Version number (e.g., `1.0.0`)
- [ ] Set Build number (e.g., `1`)
- [ ] Select your Team in Signing & Capabilities
- [ ] Enable "Automatically manage signing" or configure manual signing

### Build Settings

- [ ] Set deployment target (minimum iOS version)
- [ ] Configure app icons in Assets.xcassets
- [ ] Configure launch screen
- [ ] Remove any debug/development code flags for release

### Capabilities

- [ ] Add required capabilities in Signing & Capabilities:
  - [ ] Associated Domains (for Universal Links)
  - [ ] Push Notifications (if applicable)
  - [ ] Sign in with Apple (if applicable)
  - [ ] Background Modes (if applicable)

### Info.plist

- [ ] Add required usage descriptions:
  - [ ] `NSCameraUsageDescription` (if using camera)
  - [ ] `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` (if accessing photos)
  - [ ] `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` (if using location)
- [ ] Configure URL schemes if needed
- [ ] Set `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` to appropriate value

---

## 4. Deep Linking / Universal Links

Universal Links allow the app to open when users tap invitation links, password reset links, etc.

### Backend Configuration

The Apple App Site Association (AASA) endpoint is configured in the backend.

- [ ] Set your Team ID in `backend/cmd/tools/codegen/configs/dev.go`:

```go
AppleAppSiteAssociation: config.AppleAppSiteAssociationConfig{
    TeamID:   "XXXXXXXXXX",           // Your 10-character Team ID
    BundleID: "com.dinnerdonebetter.ios",
},
```

- [ ] Run `make configs` in backend folder to regenerate config files
- [ ] Deploy backend with updated configuration

### ADP (Apple Developer Portal)

- [ ] Enable **Associated Domains** capability on your App ID
  - Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Identifiers
  - Select your App ID
  - Enable Associated Domains
  - Save

### Xcode Configuration

- [ ] Add Associated Domains capability in Xcode (Signing & Capabilities → + Capability)
- [ ] Verify entitlements file (`ios/ios.entitlements`) contains correct domains:

```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.associated-domains</key>
<array>
    <string>applinks:www.dinnerdonebetter.dev</string>
    <string>applinks:www.dinnerdonebetter.com</string>
</array>
```

### Verification

- [ ] Verify AASA file is accessible at `https://www.dinnerdonebetter.dev/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`
- [ ] Validate with Apple's tool: <https://search.developer.apple.com/appsearch-validation-tool/>
- [ ] Test on physical device (Universal Links don't work in Simulator):
  - [ ] Send test invitation email
  - [ ] Tap link and verify app opens
  - [ ] Verify registration screen shows invitation data

### Testing Without Apple Developer Account

You can test URL parsing logic without an Apple Developer account:

```swift
#if DEBUG
// In a debug view or test
deepLinkHandler.simulateInvitationLink(
    invitationID: "test-id",
    token: "test-token"
)
#endif
```

- [ ] Run unit tests: `iosTests/DeepLinkHandlerTests.swift`

### Troubleshooting

If Universal Links aren't working:

1. Verify AASA file is at `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`
2. Ensure HTTPS with valid certificate
3. Check App ID matches `TEAMID.bundleid`
4. Clear Safari cache on device
5. Delete and reinstall app
6. Wait up to 24 hours (Apple caches AASA files)

## 5. Push Notifications

(Skip this section if not implementing push notifications)

### Developer Portal

- [ ] Enable Push Notifications on App ID
- [ ] Create APNs Key or Certificate

### Back end

- [ ] Configure push notification service (e.g., Firebase, AWS SNS)
- [ ] Store APNs credentials securely

### Xcode

- [ ] Add Push Notifications capability
- [ ] Add Background Modes → Remote notifications (if needed)

### Implementation

- [ ] Request notification permission from user
- [ ] Register for remote notifications
- [ ] Handle device token registration with backend
- [ ] Handle incoming notifications

---

## 6. App Privacy & Compliance

### Privacy Policy

- [ ] Create privacy policy document
- [ ] Host privacy policy at accessible URL
- [ ] Add URL to App Store Connect

### App Privacy Details (App Store Connect)

- [ ] Complete "App Privacy" section:
  - [ ] Data types collected
  - [ ] Data linked to user identity
  - [ ] Data used for tracking
  - [ ] Third-party data sharing

### Data Collection Disclosure

Document what data is collected:

- [ ] Account information (email, username)

- [ ] Usage data (analytics)
- [ ] Device identifiers

### Compliance
